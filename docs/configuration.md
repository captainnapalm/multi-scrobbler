# Configuration Overview

[**Sources** and **Clients**](/README.md#how-does-multi-scrobbler-ms-work) are configured using environmental (ENV) variables and/or json files.

**MS will parse configuration from both configuration types.** You can mix and match configurations but it is generally better to stick to one or the other.

TIP: Check the [**FAQ**](/docs/FAQ.md) if you have any issues after configuration!

## ENV-Based Configuration

This is done by passing environmental variables and so does not require any files to run MS.

* Using a docker container EX `docker run -e "SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=yourId" -e "SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=yourSecret" ...`
* Using a local installations by exporting variables before running MS EX `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=yourId SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=yourSecret node index.js`

Use ENV-based configuration if:

* You are the only person for whom MS is scrobbling for
* You have a very simple setup for MS such as one scrobble [Client](/README.md#client) and one [Source](/README.md#source) IE Plex -> Maloja

## File-Based Configuration

MS will parse configuration files located in the directory specified by the `CONFIG_DIR` environmental variable. This variable defaults to:

* Local installation -> `PROJECT_DIR/config`
* Docker -> `/config` (in the container) -- see the [install docs](/docs/installation.md#docker) for how to configure this correctly

Use File-based configuration if:

* You have many [Sources](/README.md#source)
* You have many of each type of **Source** you want to scrobble from IE 2x Plex accounts, 3x Spotify accounts, 1x
  Funkwhale...
* You have more than one scrobble **Client** you want to scrobble to IE multiple Maloja servers
* You want only some **Sources** to scrobble to some **Clients** IE Fred's Spotify account scrobbles to Fred's Maloja
    server, but not Mary's Maloja server

File-based configurations located in the `CONFIG_DIR` directory can be parsed from

* an **all-in-one** config file named `config.json` that contains information for all Sources and Clients and/or
* many **specific** files named based on the client/source to configure IE `plex.json` `spotify.json`

There are **example configurations** for all Source/Client types and AIO config located in the [/config](/config) directory of this project. These can be used as-is by renaming them to `.json`.
For docker installations these examples are copied to your configuration directory on first-time use.

There is also a [**kitchensink example**](/docs/kitchensink.md) that provides examples of using all sources/clients in a complex configuration.

### All-in-One File Configuration

[**Explore the schema for this configuration, along with an example generator and validator, here**](https://json-schema.app/view/%23?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FFoxxMD%2Fmulti-scrobbler%2Fdevelop%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fschema%2Faio.json)

Example directory structure:

```
/CONFIG_DIR
  config.json
```

<details>
<summary>Config Example</summary>

```json5
// in config.json
{
  //...
  "sources": [
    {
      "name": "myConfig",
      "type": "spotify",
      "clients": [
        "myMalojaClient"
      ],
      "data": {
        "clientId": "anExample"
        //...
      }
    }
  ],
  "clients": [
    {
      "name": "myFirstMalojaClient",
      "type": "maloja",
      "data": {
        "url": "http://myMalojaServer.example",
        // ...
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

</details>

`config.json` can also be used to set default behavior for all sources/clients using `sourceDefaults` and `clientDefaults` properties.

See [config.json.example](/config/config.json.example) for an annotated example or check out [the kitchen sink example](kitchensink.md).

### Specific File Configuration

Each file is named by the **type** of the Client/Source found in below sections. Each file as an **array** of that type of Client/Source.

Example directory structure:

```
/CONFIG_DIR
  plex.json
  spotify.json
  maloja.json
```

<details>
<summary>Config Example</summary>

```json5
// in maloja.json
[
  {
    "name": "myFirstMalojaClient",
    "data": {
      "url": "http://myMalojaServer.example",
      "apiKey": "myKey"
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "mySecondMalojaClient",
    "data": {
      "url": "http://my2ndMalojaServer.example",
      "apiKey": "myKey"
    }
  }
]

```

</details>

See the [/config](/config) directory of this project for examples of each type of config file or reference specific files below.

## [Subsonic](http://www.subsonic.org/)

Can use this source for any application that implements the [Subsonic API](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/api.jsp) (such as [Airsonic](https://airsonic.github.io/))

**Known Issues:**
* "Time played at" is somewhat inaccurate since the api only reports "played X minutes ago" so...
  * All scrobble times are therefore "on the minute" and you may experience occasional duplicate scrobbles
  * "played X minutes ago" sometimes is also not reported correctly
* Multiple artists are reported as one value and cannot be separated
* If using [Airsonic Advanced](https://github.com/airsonic-advanced/airsonic-advanced) the password used (under **Credentials**) must be **Decodable**

## [Deezer](https://deezer.com/)

Create a new application at [Deezer Developers](https://developers.deezer.com/myapps)

* Application Domain must be the same as your multi-scrobbler domain. Default is `localhost:9078`
* Redirect URL must end in `deezer/callback`
  * Default would be `http://localhost:9078/deezer/callback`

After application creation you should have credentials displayed in the "My Apps" dashboard. You will need:

* **Application ID**
* **Secret Key**
* **Redirect URL** (if not the default)

**If no access token is provided...**

After starting multi-scrobbler with credentials in-place open the dashboard (`http://localhost:9078`) and find your Deezer source. Click **(Re)authenticate and (re)start polling** to start the login process. After login is complete polling will begin automatically.

## [Youtube Music](https://music.youtube.com)

Credentials for YT Music are obtained from a browser request to https://music.youtube.com **once you are logged in.** [Specific requirements are here and summarized below:](https://github.com/nickp10/youtube-music-ts-api/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#authenticate)

* Open a new tab
* Open the developer tools (Ctrl-Shift-I) and select the “Network” tab 
* Go to https://music.youtube.com and ensure you are logged in 

Then...

1. Find and select an authenticated POST request. The simplest way is to filter by /browse using the search bar of the developer tools. If you don’t see the request, try scrolling down a bit or clicking on the library button in the top bar.
2. **Make sure **Headers** pane is selected and open
3. In the **Request Headers** section find and copy the **entire value** found after `Cookie:` and use this as the `cookie` value in your multi-scrobbler config
4. If present, in the **Request Headers** section find and copy the number found in `X-google-AuthUser` and use this as the value for `authUser` in your multi-scrobbler config

![Google Headers](/docs/google-header.jpg)

NOTES:

* YT Music authentication is "browser based" which means your credentials may expire after a (long?) period of time OR if you log out of https://music.youtube.com. In the event this happens just repeat the steps above to get new credentials.
* Communication to YT Music is **unofficial** and not supported or endorsed by Google. This means that **this integration may stop working at any time** if Google decides to change how YT Music works in the browser.

## [MPRIS](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/latest/)

MPRIS is a standard interface for communicating with Music Players on **linux operating systems.**

If you run Linux and have a notification tray that shows what media you are listening to, you likely have access to MPRIS.

![Notification Tray](/assets/mpris.jpg)

multi-scrobbler can listen to this interface and scrobble tracks played by **any media player** that communicates to the operating system with MPRIS.

**NOTE:** multi-scrobbler needs to be running as a [**Local Installation**](/docs/installation.md#local) in order to use MPRIS. This cannot be used from docker.

### ENV-Based

| Environmental Variable | Required? | Default | Description                                                                      |
|------------------------|-----------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MPRIS_ENABLE           | No        |         | Use MPRIS as a Source (useful when you don't need any other options)             |
| MPRIS_BLACKLIST        | No        |         | Comma-delimited list of player names not to scrobble from                        |
| MPRIS_WHITELIST        | No        |         | Comma-delimited list of players names to ONLY scrobble from. Overrides blacklist |

## [Mopidy](https://mopidy.com/)

Mopidy is a headless music server that supports playing music from many [standard and non-standard sources such as Pandora, Bandcamp, and Tunein.](https://mopidy.com/ext/)

multi-scrobbler can scrobble tracks played from any Mopidy backend source, regardless of where you listen to them.

### File-Based

See [`mopidy.json.example`](/config/mopidy.json.example) or [explore the schema with an example and live editor/validator](https://json-schema.app/view/%23%2Fdefinitions%2FMopidySourceConfig/%23%2Fdefinitions%2FMopidyData?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FFoxxMD%2Fmulti-scrobbler%2Fdevelop%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fschema%2Fsource.json)

Configuration Options:

##### `url`

The URL used to connect to the Mopidy server. You MUST have [Mopidy-HTTP extension](https://mopidy.com/ext/http) enabled.

If no `url` is provided a default is used which assumes Mopidy is installed on the same server as multi-scrobbler: `ws://localhost:6680/mopidy/ws/`

Make sure the hostname and port number match what is found in the Mopidy configuration file `mopidy.conf`:

```
...

[http]
hostname = localhost
port = 6680

...
```

The URL used to connect ultimately must be formed like this: `[protocol]://[hostname]:[port]/[path]`
If any part of this URL is missing multi-scrobbler will use a default value, for your convenience. This also means that if any part of your URL is **not** standard you must explicitly define it.

Part => Default Value

* Protocol => `ws://`
* Hostname => `localhost`
* Port => `6680`
* Path => `/mopidy/ws/`

EX

```json
{
  "url": "mopidy.mydomain.com"
}
```

MS transforms this to: `ws://mopidy.mydomain.com:6680/mopidy/ws/`

```json
{
  "url": "192.168.0.101:3456"
}
```

MS transforms this to: `ws://192.168.0.101:3456/mopidy/ws/`

```json
{
  "url": "mopidy.mydomain.com:80/MOPWS"
}
```

MS transforms this to: `ws://mopidy.mydomain.com:80/MOPWS`


#### URI Blacklist/Whitelist

If you wish to disallow or only allow scrobbling from some sources played through Mopidy you can specify these using `uriBlacklist` or `uriWhitelist` in your config. multi-scrobbler will check the list to see if any string matches the START of the `uri` on a track. If whitelist is used then blacklist is ignored. All strings are case-insensitive.

EX:

```json
{
  "uriBlacklist": ["soundcloud"]
}
```

Will prevent multi-scrobbler from scrobbling any Mopidy track that start with a `uri` like `soundcloud:song:MySong-1234`

#### Album Blacklist

For certain sources (Soundcloud) Mopidy does not have all track info (Album) and will instead use "Soundcloud" as the Album name. You can prevent multi-scrobbler from using this bad Album data by adding the fake Album name to this list. Multi-scrobbler will still scrobble the track, just without the bad data. All strings are case-insensitive.

EX:

```json
{
  "albumBlacklist": ["SoundCloud", "Mixcloud"]
}
```

If a track would be scrobbled like `Album: Soundcloud, Track: My Cool Track, Artist: A Cool Artist` 
then multi-scrobbler will instead scrobble  `Track: My Cool Track, Artist: A Cool Artist`

multi-scrobbler supports some common webhooks and a healthcheck endpoint in order to monitor Sources and Clients for errors.

## Webhook Configurations

Webhooks will **push** a notification to your configured servers on these events:

* Source polling started 
* Source polling retry
* Source polling stopped on error 
* Scrobble client scrobble failure

Webhooks are configured in the main [config.json](#all-in-one-file-configuration) file under the `webhook` top-level property. Multiple webhooks may be configured for each webhook type. EX:

```json
{
  "sources": [
    ...
  ],
  "clients": [
    ...
  ],
  "webhooks": [
    {
      "name": "FirstGotifyServer",
      "type": "gotify",
      "url": "http://192.168.0.100:8070",
      "token": "abcd"
    }, 
    {
      "name": "SecondGotifyServer",
      "type": "gotify",
      ...
    },
    {
      "name": "NtfyServerOne",
      "type": "ntfy",
      ...
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### [Gotify](https://gotify.net/)

Refer to the [config schema for GotifyConfig](https://json-schema.app/view/%23/%23%2Fdefinitions%2FGotifyConfig?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FFoxxMD%2Fmulti-scrobbler%2Fdevelop%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fschema%2Faio.json)

multi-scrobbler optionally supports setting message notification priority via `info` `warn` and `error` mappings.

EX

```json
{
  "type": "gotify",
  "name": "MyGotifyFriendlyNameForLogs",
  "url": "http://192.168.0.100:8070",
  "token": "AQZI58fA.rfSZbm",
  "priorities": {
    "info": 5,
    "warn": 7,
    "error": 10
  }
}
```

### [Ntfy](https://ntfy.sh/)

Refer to the [config schema for NtfyConfig](https://json-schema.app/view/%23/%23%2Fdefinitions%2FNtfyConfig?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FFoxxMD%2Fmulti-scrobbler%2Fdevelop%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fschema%2Faio.json)

multi-scrobbler optionally supports setting message notification priority via `info` `warn` and `error` mappings.

EX

```json
{
  "type": "ntfy",
  "name": "MyNtfyFriendlyNameForLogs",
  "url": "http://192.168.0.100:9991",
  "topic": "RvOwKJ1XtIVMXGLR",
  "username": "Optional",
  "password": "Optional",
  "priorities": {
    "info": 3,
    "warn": 4,
    "error": 5
  }
}
```

## Health Endpoint

An endpoint for monitoring the health of sources/clients is available at GET `http://YourMultiScrobblerDomain/health`

* Returns `200 OK` when **everything** is working or `500 Internal Server Error` if **anything** is not 
* The plain url (`/health`) aggregates status of **all clients/sources** -- so any failing client/source will make status return 500 
  * Use query params `type` or `name` to restrict client/sources aggregated IE `/health?type=spotify` or `/health?name=MyMaloja`
* On 500 the response returns a JSON payload with `messages` array that describes any issues
  * For any clients/sources that require authentication `/health` will return 500 if they are **not authenticated** 
  * For sources that poll (spotify, yt music, subsonic) `/health` will 500 if they are **not polling**
