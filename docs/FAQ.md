# Connection Issues

## Plex/Tautulli/Jellyfin don't connect

These three [sources](/README.md#source) are **ingress-based** which means that multi-scrobbler waits for the Plex/Tautulli/Jellyfin server to contact multi-scrobbler, as opposed to multi-scrobbler contacting the server.

multi-scrobbler will log information about any server that connects to it for these three services. In the logs it looks something like this:

```
2023-02-22T10:55:56-05:00 info   : [Ingress - Plex  ] Received request from a new remote address: ::ffff:192.168.0.140 (UA: PlexMediaServer/1.24.5.5173-8dcc73a59)
2023-02-22T10:55:56-05:00 info   : [Ingress - Plex  ] ::ffff:192.168.0.140 (UA: PlexMediaServer/1.24.5.5173-8dcc73a59) Received valid data from server examplePlex for the first time.
2023-02-22T10:55:56-05:00 warn   : [Plex Request    ] Received valid Plex webhook payload but no Plex sources are configured
```
It also logs if a server tries to connect to a URL that it does not recognize:

```
2023-02-22T11:16:12-05:00 debug  : [App             ] Server received POST request from ::ffff:192.168.0.140 (UA: PlexMediaServer/1.24.5.5173-8dcc73a59) to unknown route: /plkex
```
**So, if you do not see either of these in your logs then Plex/Tautulli/Jellyfin is not able to connect to your multi-scrobbler instance at all.**

This is not something multi-scrobbler can fix and means you have an issue in your network.

### Troubleshooting 

Check or try all these steps before submitting an issue:

#### Turn on Debug Logging

First, turn on **debug** logging for multi-scrobbler by setting the environmental variable `LOG_LEVEL=debug`:

* using node `LOG_LEVEL=debug ... node src/index.js`
* using docker `docker run -e LOG_LEVEL=debug ... foxxmd/multi-scrobbler`

Check the output for any additional information.

#### Check Host name and URL

The URLs examples in the [configuration](/docs/configuration.md) documentation assume you are running Plex/Tautulli/Jellyfin on the same server as multi-scrobbler. If these are not the same machine then you need to determine the IP address or domain name that multi-scrobbler is reachable at and use that instead of `localhost` when configuring these sources. **This is likely the same host name that you would use to access the web interface for multi-scrobbler.**

EX `http://localhost:9078/plex` -> `http://192.168.0.140:9078/plex`

#### Check Firewall and Port Forwarding

If the machine multi-scrobbler is running on has a firewall ensure that port **9078** is open. Or if it is in another network entirely make sure your router is forwarding this port and it is open to the correct machine.

#### Check Source Service Logs

Plex/Tautulli/Jellyfin all have logs that will log if they cannot connect to multi-scrobbler. Check these for further information.

##### Plex

Settings -> Manage -> Console

##### Tautulli

Check the command-line output of the application or docker logs.

##### Jellyfin

Administration -> Dashboard -> Advanced -> Logs

## Jellyfin has warnings about undefined or missing data

Make sure you have 
* [Configured the webhook plugin correctly](/docs/configuration.md#jellyfin)
  * Checked the **Send All Properties(ignores template)** option in the webhook settings and **Saved**

multi-scrobbler is known to work on Jellyfin `10.8.9` with Webhook version `11.0.0.0`.

You can verify the payload sent from the webhook by modifying your jellyfin configuration to include `logPayload: true` which will output the raw payload to DEBUG level logging:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "MyJellyfin",
    "clients": [],
    "data": {
      "users": ["FoxxMD"],
      "options": {
        "logPayload": true
      }
    }
  }
]
```

If your issue persists and you open an Issue for it please include the raw payload logs in your report.


## Spotify/Deezer/LastFM won't authenticate

Ensure any **client id** or **secrets** are correct in your configuration.

The callback/redirect URL for these services must be:

* the same address you would use to access the multi-scrobbler web interface
  * the web-interface must be accessible from the browser you are completing authentication from.

If multi-scrobbler is not running on the same machine your browser is on then the default/example addresses (`http://localhost...`) **will not work.** You must determine the address you can reach the web interface at (such as `http://192.168.0.140:9078`) then use that in place of `localhost` in the callback URLs.

EX `http://localhost:9078/lastfm/callback` -> `http://192.168.0.220:9078/lastfm/callback`

# Configuration Issues

## Config could not be parsed

If you see something like this in your logs:

```
2023-02-19T10:05:42-06:00 warn   : [App] App config file exists but could not be parsed!
2023-02-19T10:05:42-06:00 error  : [App] Exited with uncaught error
2023-02-19T10:05:42-06:00 error  : [App] Error: config.json could not be parsed
```

It means the JSON in your configuration file is not valid. Copy and paste your configuration into a site like [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/) to find out where errors you have and fix them.
