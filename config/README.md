These are **example configurations** for all Source/Client types and AIO config.

These can be used as-is by renaming them to `.json` and filling or replacing sample data.

For docker installations these examples are copied to your configuration directory on first-time use.

These are **NOT** exhaustive examples. You should consult the  **configuration** documentation and the **schema explorer links** for each source/config type to see a complete list of options and descriptions for all properties.
